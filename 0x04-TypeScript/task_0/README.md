This project demonstrates basic TypeScript interface usage combined with DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript.

Key features:

- Defines a `Student` interface with properties:
  - `firstName` (string)
  - `lastName` (string)
  - `age` (number)
  - `location` (string)
- Creates two student objects implementing the `Student` interface.
- Stores these student objects in an array called `studentsList`.
- Uses vanilla JavaScript in `main.ts` to dynamically generate an HTML table.
- For each student in the array, a new row is appended to the table displaying the student's first name and location.

Configuration files included:

- `package.json`
- `.eslintrc.js`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `webpack.config.js`
