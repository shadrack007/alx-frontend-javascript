# TypeScript Projects Summary (task_0 to task_5)

This repository contains a series of TypeScript projects demonstrating fundamental and intermediate TypeScript concepts, including interfaces, classes, type safety, namespaces, and DOM manipulation.

## Overview of Tasks

- **task_0**  
  Defines a `Student` interface and creates student objects. Renders a dynamic HTML table using vanilla JavaScript to display student first names and locations.

- **task_1**  
  Builds interfaces and classes for `Teacher` and `Directors`, demonstrating optional and flexible properties. Implements a function to print teacher names in a specific format and a class for `StudentClass` with methods.

- **task_2**  
  Implements employee-related interfaces and classes (`Director`, `Teacher`), functions for type discrimination, and a string literal type for subjects with functions handling class teaching logic.

- **task_3**  
  Defines types and interfaces for database row elements. Integrates an external CRUD library with ambient type declarations, ensuring type-safe usage of imported functions.

- **task_4**  
  Uses namespaces, interface merging, and class inheritance to model school subjects (`Cpp`, `React`, `Java`) and their teachers with conditional methods based on experience.

- **task_5**  
  Demonstrates branded interfaces (`MajorCredits`, `MinorCredits`) to create strongly typed credit values and functions that sum credits safely.

## Included Configuration Files

Each task directory contains essential configuration files such as:

- `package.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `webpack.config.js`
- `.eslintrc.js`

## Notes

- All tasks compile without TypeScript errors.
- Projects follow strict typing and best TypeScript practices.
- Tasks incrementally build complexity from basic interfaces to advanced type techniques and namespace management.
