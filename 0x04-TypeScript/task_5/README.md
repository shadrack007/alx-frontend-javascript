# task_5: Brand convention & Nominal typing

This project demonstrates the use of TypeScript interfaces with branding to create type-safe distinctions between `MajorCredits` and `MinorCredits`.

It includes:

- Two interfaces, `MajorCredits` and `MinorCredits`, each with a `credits` number and a unique brand property to ensure type safety.
- Two functions, `sumMajorCredits` and `sumMinorCredits`, which take two arguments of their respective types and return the sum of their credits.
- A basic TypeScript and Webpack setup with configuration files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `webpack.config.js`) for building the project.
